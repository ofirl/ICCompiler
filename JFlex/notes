JFlex manual : http://jflex.de/manual.pdf - 
	the first example is good starting point for us.
	
note : 
currently the cup optimization makes an error at the end of file,
because we are returning a Token and not a Symbol, possible fixes :
1. return a symbol (against what the power point presentation says) 
	and convert the symbol to token in our code.
2. find how to override the default behavior for the EOF.

in the mean time : (i'll fix it tomorrow, but if you want to run it)
if you compile the .lex file with JFlex (put the Lexer.java file in same folder),
it will throw an error in the EOF function, switch the "return new Symbol(...);" with :
"return new Token(sym.EOF, "EOF", 0 , 0);"

To Do list :
1. check what other tags are needed.
2. fix error handling
